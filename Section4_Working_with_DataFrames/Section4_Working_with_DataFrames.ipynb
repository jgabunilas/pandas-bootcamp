When we observe random phenomena in the real world, we are witness \"natural attributes\", or **true randomness**. That is, **what we observe now tells us nothing about what will come next**. You will get no predictiveness out of this.\n","\n","In practice, it is difficult to sample a truly random attribute.\n","\n","At random.org, they use atmospheric measurements and use that stream of randomness to generate numbers, streams, names, etc. It is true randomness that is supported by (as far as we can tell) a truly random natural phenomenon.\n","\n","By contrast, computer programs create **pseudorandomness**. Computers are generally very algorithmic, following a set of rules for generating numbers. They cannot on their own generate numbers. For this reason, computer scientists have generated pseudo-random number generators (**PRNG**s). They start with a piece of input, and then from there they predictively generate a sequence of numbers. The catch is that these generators behave they eventually repeat themselves in a non-random fashion.\n","\n","Python uses the Mersenne Twister, one of the most widely-used PRNGs.\n","\n","Circling back to our `sample()` method in Pandas, by seeding a `random_state`, we lock down the starting input.
