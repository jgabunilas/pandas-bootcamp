Yes we can. Suppose we wanted to add a new player to our *df_mini* dataframe.\n","\n","The first approach is using the `append()` method. It accepts a dataframe, a series, or a list of dataframes or series.

We will build this Series using a dictionary, where the keys are the keys are the column names and the values are what we enter.
